Potential benefits of terminology management: the case of the Open Contracting Partnership
==================================================================================

# Context

The [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) publishes the documentation of their standard, the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/), in English and two other languages: French and Spanish.

The documentation of the standard is what implementers will read to properly understand and use the standard, so that contracting data can be published by many public organizations around the world. Publishing this documentation in three languages makes it more accessible, and even if English is the reference documentation, translations should be highly trustworthy, or they won't be relied upon. And if they are not relied upon, they are not worth the effort of making them.

A high level of trust is achieved through quality, and quality is achieved through:

- proper processes
- proper tooling

The processes define the different steps that are undergone, and by who, to produce the deliverables:

- the source content (writing)
- the multilingual glossary of terms (a.k.a. terminological database)
- the translated content

The tools support the processes and make the various steps easier and less prone to errors for those who undertake them: scheduling, automation, batch processing, statistics, etc.

In this note, I'll focus on terminology processes and tooling, as it's the foundation of an efficient communication.

# What is terminology?

Terminology is the science of managing terms and their characteristics. A term is a word that is specific to a domain and that is key to understand the content. In the domain of public contracting, "buyer" is definitely a term, and it doesn't have the exact same definition in the domain, let's say, grocery stores. This is why terms deserve a 5-star treatment.

The characteristics of a term may include:

- a definition
- if not written by the publisher of the glossary, the source of the definition (be careful of copyright)
- a sample sentence where the term appears
- grammatical characteristics (genre, nature, function, etc.)
- synonyms
- antonyms
- etc.

For an organization that produces content for a specific domain, proper terminology management ensures that the correct terms are used consistently across the produced content. As a result:

- writers know what term they should use and what synonyms exist
- translators know what the source terms mean and are consequently better informed to find a matching term in the target language
- readers read content where one word is consistently used for the same meaning

Finally, an organization that publishes their glossary of terms proves its expertise in its domain.

# Terminology for translation

When translating technical content, terminology is key to map concepts from the source language to the target language. It is up to the translator to find the right term in the target language. However, it's much more difficult if the meaning of the source term is unclear, or worse, inconsistent in the content. The translator probably knows what the source term usually means, but can never be sure that's it's the same meaning as the one intended by the original writer. This difficulty results in:

- slower translation throughput time
- inconsistency
- higher risk of poorly translated term

The writers of the source content are knowledgeable in the domain they write for, and consequently know the meaning of the terms they use. The intended meaning and other properties of the terms should be made available upstream in a glossary of terms and shared, if not publicly, at least with the writers and the translators.

# Terminology for communication

An organization like the Open Contracting Partnership produces a lot of content in the domain of public contracting and data management, including:

- the specification of the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/)
- the blog posts
- the tweets ([@OpenContracting](https://twitter.com/opencontracting) and [@ocdata](https://twitter.com/ocdata))
- the training content
- the presentations and speeches

All this content serves the purpose of the organization: promoting greater transparency in the public contracting processes.

A well-managed terminological database would be key here, as transmitting a consistent message and mastering the definition of the employed terms boosts readability and credibility.

If published, this database also increases the influence and popularity of the organization in its domain. Professionnals of the covered domains may consider the Open Contracting Partnership as a reference and share links to the entries of the online glossary with their community. They may also suggest improvements, refining the quality of the glossary.

# Way forward

1. collecting the terms in the source content
2. writing definitions or gathering them (don't forget to source external definitions)
3. defining the other required characteristics for each term
4. setting up a tool to manage and share, possibly publicly, the glossary of terms (hint: not a spreadsheet)
5. setting up term creation and update processes
5. translating the terms
