In the past year, translation requirements got more pressing at NXP. Several business lines asked for translation of their marketing category pages and product information pages. These sections are easy to identify on nxp.com, as they can be browsed from the tree on the left, in the black box.

Before setting up a corporate process that would benefit to all business lines, each business line took care of their translation needs separately. No translation memories were used, thus no reuse of previous translations, and the translation jobs were very small. NXP staff also spent a lot of time preparing the content for translation and injecting the translations back in the system. All in all, translating was expensive and inefficient.

The migration of the value proposition content to DITA XML, an OASIS standard dedicated to the management of document at component level (instead of document level, see this blog post), was the trigger to think translation bigger and, above all, smarter.

## Translation management system: bigger is not better

From the start, a few key requirements were defined:

* standard formats (no vendor lock)
* central repository to optimize reuse of translations
* global access for translation agencies

Among the costly, proprietary white elephants and the lightweight, small team solutions, a tool suite quickly emerged: XTM Suite, by XTM International.

Beside fulfilling the requirements above, XTM Suite proposed a good user interface and responsive support. XTM serves as:
* translation repository for translation memories (one per high level business unit)
* terminology manager
* translation project manager
* Web-based translation editor (thatâ€™s right, translators work directly in our system, no exchange of files)

Regarding the support of standard formats, XTM converts our DITA XML content to XLIFF upon project creation out of the box.
